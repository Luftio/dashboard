# After action layout

This is a simple layout for our sign out page, where user can also sign back in.

export const Component = () => <AfterAction />;
export const ComponentAfterDelete = () => <AfterAction afterdelete />;

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Sign Out">{Component}</Story>
  <Story name="After Delete">{ComponentAfterDelete}</Story>
</Canvas>
