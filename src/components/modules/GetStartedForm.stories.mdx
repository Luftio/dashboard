# Sign Up form

This is our Sign Up form. At this stage, our onboarding process starts. After a user fills this form, they get a verify-email page, which is a sign of successfully filled form and also they are provided with most used e-mail clients so they can jump right in.

If they find out that they have Luftio account already, they can go to Sign In page.

export const Component = () => <SignUpForm />;

  <Story name="Sign up form">{Component}</Story>
