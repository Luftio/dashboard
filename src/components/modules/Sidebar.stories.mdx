# Sidebar

This is our Sidebar. It has four areas:

1. Menu - place where all inportant pages live. Think of it as a go to part of sidebar.
1. Account - place where user manages his account.
1. Others - Mix of thing that doesn't fit into any other area of sidebar
1. Sign Out - This is more "hidden" becauase it's much lower then other areas and user won't used that often.

export const Component = () => <Sidebar />;

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Sidebar">{Component}</Story>
</Canvas>
