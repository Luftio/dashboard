# Email Clients

We did a research and find that these three email clients are the most used ones in Czech Republic. So when sending an activation email or instructions for changing password, there is a good change that the user can have one from this three.

export const Component = () => <EmailClients />;

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Email clients">{Component}</Story>
</Canvas>
