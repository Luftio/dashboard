# Buttons

In our low-level design system, we have currently 3 types of buttons.

1. Default that is used the most through our entire application.
2. Primary button that is used when submitting forms and to confirm steps in "danger zone".
3. Email button that is used with email clients".

You can see the examples right under this text.

export const Component = (args) => <Button>{args.text}</Button>;
export const ComponentButton = (args) => <Button primary>{args.text}</Button>;
export const ComponentEmail = (args) => <Button email>{args.text}</Button>;

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Default"
    args={{
      text: "I`m default",
    }}
  >
    {Component}
  </Story>
  <Story
    name="Primary"
    args={{
      text: "I`m primary",
    }}
  >
    {ComponentButton}
  </Story>
  <Story
    name="Email"
    args={{
      text: "I`m email",
    }}
  >
    {ComponentEmail}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
