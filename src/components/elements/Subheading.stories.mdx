# Subheading

We have more types of subheadings:

1. Simple subheading that is dispaled under heading in sign in and onboarding process.
2. Simple subheading that is dispaled on after action pages. It is white so turn the background here in Storybook to dark.
3. Simple heading of each dashboard page.

export const Component = (args) => <Subheading>{args.text}</Subheading>;
export const ComponentSignOut = (args) => <Subheading afterAction>{args.text}</Subheading>;
export const ComponentDashboard = (args) => <Subheading dashboard>{args.text}</Subheading>;
